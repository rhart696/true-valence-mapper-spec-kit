# Specification Quality Checklist: Keyboard Shortcuts

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified

- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

- 5 user stories prioritized P1-P5, each independently testable
- 12 functional requirements covering all keyboard interactions
- 6 success criteria with measurable outcomes
